        <h1>Enable G - Empowering Lives Through UpSkilling</h1>
        
        <p>Enable G is a non-profit organisation founded by David Hay in 2021 after his retirement as a businessman and entrepreneur. It started in Cape Town, South Africa, and has now expanded to Bali and across South and Central America.</p>
        
        <p>Our mission is to help individuals improve their lives by developing personal and business skills. We offer guidance and resources to support both personal and career growth. This could mean learning how to live a more balanced life, improving relationships, or strengthening finances. For some, it’s about improving English skills to enhance job opportunities or learning how to start a business with marketing and sales skills.</p>
        
        <p>Young adults, in particular, benefit from learning life skills while engaging with people from different countries and cultures, giving them a broader view of the world and its opportunities.</p>
        
        <p>The heart of Enable G’s vision is to create local support communities. After receiving support from Enable G, we encourage “graduates” to give back by sharing what they’ve learned with others in their community.</p>
